				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Guardians of Sunshine is a recreation of a game by the same name from the cartoon Adventure Time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used Phaser to create a browser game that is a recreation of the simplistic game from Adventure Time. The game was programmed in JavaScript. The main character is controlled with basic player input from the keyboard and utilizes a basic custom state machine.
				The game is a simple platformer with a few obstacles, enemies, and coins to collect. All of the artwork, sounds, and programming was done by me as this was a solo project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was tough to create because I was too ambitious given the time I had. I had only three weeks to make this game. I spent more time than I thought I was going to on creating the artwork and background for the game. Overall, I am happy with how it turned out and am glad I get to showcase it.</p>
